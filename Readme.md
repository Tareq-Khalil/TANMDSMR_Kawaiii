# The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten - Fan Website

A comprehensive fan website for the anime series "The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten" (Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsu no Ma ni ka Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken). This project demonstrates modern web development techniques while providing an engaging platform for anime fans.

## About the Project

This website serves as a central hub for fans of the romantic comedy anime series. It combines informational content with interactive features to create an immersive fan experience. The site includes character profiles, episode tracking functionality, an image gallery, user reviews, and news updates.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
The website is built as a single-page application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach was chosen for simplicity and fast loading times while maintaining full functionality.

### Styling Framework
Tailwind CSS v2.2.19 is used as the primary styling framework, providing:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Responsive design utilities
- Built-in color palette and component classes

Custom CSS supplements Tailwind for:
- Complex animations and transitions
- Custom gradient backgrounds
- Interactive hover effects
- Theme switching functionality

### Typography and Fonts
Google Fonts integration provides the Poppins font family, offering:
- Multiple font weights (300, 400, 500, 600, 700)
- Modern, clean appearance
- Excellent readability across devices

## Key Features and Implementation

## Code Structure and Organization

### HTML Structure
The document follows semantic HTML5 principles:

### CSS Architecture
Styles are organized into:

- State management for theme and progress tracking
- Animation control and cleanup

## Performance Considerations

### Loading Optimization
- Single HTML file reduces HTTP requests

- Efficient CSS and JavaScript bundling

### Animation Performance
- CSS transforms instead of layout changes
